      <h1> "Online" Algorithms (Data Streams): Ideas and code </h1>
      <a>
        A stream of data refers to the continuous arrival of inputs at a very fast rate with limited capacity to store it. Algorithms have to work with such fast data, preferrably in linear time and size. Some methods rely on metric embeddings,
        pseudo-random computations, sparse approzimation theory and communication complexity.
        Some scenarios of data streams include:
      </a>

      <ul>
        <li> <a> Social Media Feeds, such as interactions with photos, posts, comments and other objects in social platform like Instagram, Facebook or others; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> Financial Transactions, such as the continuous flow of money in the stock marker and currency exchange rates; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> IP network traffic analisys, including the flow of packets accross the network infrastructure; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> Sensor data, particularly from IoT devices such as temperature, altitude, pressure and other factors of interest; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> Processing of large data sets. </a> </li>
      </ul>

      <a>
        <b> Online algorithms </b> are designed to work with data as it arrives, instead of waiting for the whole dataset to be available. This is especially important if we are talking about a virtually never ending data set, such as the
        information relied to the algorithm from an IoT sensor.
         Let's condier how to

      <h2> Counting elements in a stream </h2>
      <a>
        In this case we intend to process incrementally counts of occurences. It could be used with a thermal sensor to count the occurences of a particular temperature. A mathematical descriptions is the following:
        Let \( S = [s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, ... ] \) be an infinite sequence that rapresents a data stream. In particular, we consider the i-th item to be \( s_i \). We mean to produce a set of items \( I \) defined as
        \( I = \{(x_1, c_1), (x_2, c_2), (x_3, c_3), (x_4, c_4), (x_5, c_5), (x_6, c_6), (x_7, c_7)\} \) where \( x_i \) refers to the value assumed in the infinite series, and \( c_j \) refers to the number of times that item has appeared in the sequence.
        In particular we consider the following rules:
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li> <a> If \( s_i \) is not in I, then \( I' = I \cup \{(s_i, 1)\} \) </a> </li>
        <li> <a> If \( s_i \) is already in I, then \( I' = ( I \setminus \{ (s_i, x_i) \} ) \cup \{(s_i, x_i + 1)\} \) </a> </li>
      </ul>
      <a>
        This is an example of how this behaviour could be achieved with an hashmap:
      </a>

      <pre style="font-family: Menlo, monospace; font-size: large; border-style: solid; width: fit-content; padding-right: 50px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <code>
    function CountStreamElements(stream){
      HashMap hm = new HashMap()

      for each item in stream{
        // I am using the ternary operator to speed up the process.
        hm[item] = (item exists in hm) ? hm[item] + 1 : 1
      }
    }
        </code> </pre>

      <h2> Calculating the moving average </h2>
      <a>
        This process aims to compute the average of a fixed-size amount of elements
        as the algorithm moves throught the data stream. We again consider \( S = [s_1, s_2, s_3, ...] \)
        the datastream ad define \( MovAvg(S, w) \) a function that requires as input a datastream
        and a positive integer \( w \) that will be the window size. This function
        produces a sequence of moving averages \( M = [m_1, m_2, m_3, ...] \) where \( m_i \)
        is the i-th element is the average in the span from \( s_i \) to \( s_{s+w-1} \).
        The algorithm can be described as follows:
      </a>

      <ul>
        <li> <a> If \( i < w \) then \( m_i = \sum^{i}_{j=1} s_j \), the average of the first i elements, </a> </li>
        <li> If \( i \ge w \) then \( m_i = \sum^{i}_{j=i-w+1} s_j \), which is the average of the last w elements in the stream.<a> </a> </li>
      </ul>

      <a> The pseudocode is written here: </a>
      <pre style="font-family: Menlo, monospace; font-size: large; border-style: solid; width: fit-content; padding-right: 50px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <code>
    function MovingAverage(stream, win_size){
      win_sum = 0
      win = empty list

      i = 1
      while i < stream length {
        win_sum += stream[i]
        win.add(stream[i])

        if i >= win_size {
          // Here the moving average is calculated
          moving_average = win_sum / win_size
          

          win_sum -= win[i - win_size]
          win.remove(stream[i - win_size])
        }

        i++
      }
    }
  </code> </pre>
    
      <h2> Finding the top k elements </h2>
      <a>
        This algorithms aims to find the set of the largest k elements in the dataset.
        This can be achieved by using a sorted collection of data to keep track of the largest elements.
        In particular, we consider a stream \( S = [s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, ...] \) and define a function
        \( TopKElements(S, k) \) that takes as input a datastream \( S \) and a positive integer \( k \).
        This produces the set of the top k elements \( T = \{t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, ... \} \).
        To store the highest elements we could use a list and a fast sorting function, like quick sort or merge sort.
        We can also keep in mind that, since the list will always be limited to k+1 elements, sorting functions
        like insertion sort or selection sort are viable as well. Quick sort does the best job since it can be implemented
        in-place and has a maximum time of \( O(n log(n)) \). The pseudo code is written down here:
      </a>

      <pre style="font-family: Menlo, monospace; font-size: large; border-style: solid; width: fit-content; padding-right: 50px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <code>
    function TopKElements(stream, k){

      top = empty list

      for i from 0 to stream length {
        top.add(stream[i])

        if top size > k {
          top.sort() // descending order
          top.remove(k) // remove last element, which is the smallest
        }
      }
    }
        </code> </pre>
