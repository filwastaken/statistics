      <h2 style="color: white; background-color: black; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> Stochastic processes </h2>
      <p>
        Stochastic processes have a crucial impact in many applications, they hold the power to mathematically model the evolution of systems over time.
        They are often described by <b>stochastic differential equations</b>, also known as "SDE" and help examine, evaluate and simulate a particular model.
        In particular, a <b>stochastic process</b>, or random process, is a mathematical object defined in probability theory and used across most probability
        courses and related fields that models a given system. This process is usually defined as a sequence of random variables, where the index is an
        interpretation for time. They can either be <b>discrete</b> or <b>continuous</b> regarding time and are widely used as mathematical models of
        systems and phenomena that appear to behave randomly.
      </p>
      <h3>Discrete time</h3>
      <p>
        In discrete-time, the random variables evolves at at distinct and particular points in time. In this case, we consider to process to behave and evolve
        only at those points in time, since there is no in between. More in general, discrete distributions deal with variables that takes distinct valunes, such
        as any variable that has a value with a finite and numerical interval. An example may be the number of people in a room, since it will never assume any number
        that is not contained in \( \mathbb{N} \). These distributions are defined by the <b>probability mass function</b> (PMF). This calculates the probability
        that the random variable will assume a specific value when drawn (in a random occurrence):
        $$ Pr(X = a) $$
        We can define a random variable \(  v(t) \) at time \( t \) as the outcomes of the same experiment modeled by the discrete stochastic process at different time.
        This means that \( v(t) = \varphi(s, t) \), with \( t \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \). If the time is fixed ( \( t = \overline{t} \) ), then \( \varphi(s, \overline{t}) \)
        is a random variable.
      </p>
      <h3> Continuous time </h3>
      <p>
        In continuous-time however, the process evolves and behaves continuously, since there are no points where the process will either exists or not.
        This kind of process exists, behave and evolve for the entire given time, continuously. In general, continuous distribution are associated with random
        variables that can assume any value given a range. Some examples could be an height (1.788 meters) or a temperature (36.85 \( C^o \)).
        Continuous distribution are described with the <b>probability density function</b> (PDF), used to calculate where the random variable will assume
        value less then or equal to the one calculated:
        $$ Pr(a \le X \le b) \text{ or } Pr(X \le c) $$

      <h2> Properties of stochastic process </h2>
      <p>
        Stochastic processes have different properties. 
      </p>

      <ol type="I">
        <li>
          A stochastic process is said to be <b> strongly stationary </b> if its random properties don't change over time. In particular, we expect a strongly
          stationary stochastic process to keep its mean, variance and correlation structure over time. More formally, it is such if the statistical properties
          that are true at times \( T = [t_1, t_2, t_3, ...] \) are true at the times \( T' = T + \tau = [t_1 + \tau, t_2 + \tau, t_3 + \tau, t_4 + \tau, ...] \);
        </li>

        <li>
          A stochastic process is said to be <b>weak-sense stationary</b> if the expected value is constant at any time \( t \) and the covariance between times
          \( (t_1, t_2) \) and \( (t_3, t_4) \) are the same if the time difference is the same:
          $$ |t_2 - t_1| = |t_4 - t_3| = \tau $$
        </li>

        <li>
          A stochastic process is said to be <b> martingale </b> if its expected value at any future time is equal to its current value.
          This mean that a martingale stochastic process will assume one and only one expected value, which will remain constant forever;
          A martingal process is any fiar game, where the player cannot gain or lose any advantage by knowing the past outcome.
        </li>

        <li>
          A stochastic process is said to be <b> ergodic </b> if the time average of a random variable converges to the expected value as time goes to infinity.
          In particular, the ergodic property indicate that the long-term behvaiour of a system modeled by the stochastic process is indipendent from the inital condition,
          and that the systen explores all possible states with equal probability. An example of an ergodic system is the sum of the number extracted from a fair dice:
          each number has the same probability that it will be chosen randomly \( \frac{1}{6} \), and knowing the dice extraction's past does not give any
          information that can be used, since the expected value is constant to \( \frac{S_n}{n} = 3.5 \);
        </li>

        <li>
          A stochastic process is said to be <b>indipendent</b> if its increments are indipendent random variables. This means that the future values of the process
          do not depend on the assumed values in the past. An example is the Poisson process, an indipendent random process, since the number of events that occur in a
          time interval, and its increment in any time interval is indipendent of its value before that interval;
        </li>

        <li>
          A stochastic process is said to be <b>continuous</b> if its <i>sample paths are continuous functions of the index set</i>.
          In particular, this means that there are no jumps or breaks over the possible values that the random process can assume.
          For example, while a Brownian motion can indicate the continuous movemenet of particles in fluids such as air, other processes do not have this possibility,
          such as the Poisson process. This is true since the Poisson process is used to predict the number of occurence of events in a time interval, and cannot handle
          continuous numbers;
        </li>

        <li>
          A stochastic process has the <b> Markov property </b> if the future behvaiour of the process depends on its current state and not its past history.
          This means that, taken two identical stochastic process, where one started from point \( a \), moved to \( b \) and ended in \( c \); while the other one
          started from point \( b \), moved to \( a \) and ended in \( c \). If these two processes hold the Markov properties, then they will behave the same, since
          they're described only by the state they are in ( \( c \) ) and the underlying distribution.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Applications </h3>

      <p>
        There are many application for stochastic processes, from biology, chemistry, neuroscience, psychology, image processing, statistical signal processing,
        control theory, computer science, cryptography, telecommunications, ecology and others. Some of the most important are:
      </p>

      <ul type="circle">
        <li>
          <b>Cryptography</b>: stochastic processes are used in cryptography to generate random numbers to model the behaviour of cryptographic systems.
          Another way stochsatic processes are used is for the generation of prime factors to create a pair of private and public keys in asymmetric encryption;
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Queueing theory</b>: stochastic processes are used in queuing theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the act of waiting in line. These processes
          are used to model and analyze the flow of customers arriving and leaving the general facility, queuing, being served and leaving. This branch of applications
          is used especially in communication networks among other;
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Machine learning</b>: stochastic processes are used to model physical and engineering systems, such that a computer can reason around it and arrive at
          conclusion thanks to a randomly chaning model of reality. This will help the final artificial interlligence to resolve around unexpected behvaiour
          and level of complessity that are not directly translatable in code, or machine language, especially thanks to the use of a <b>Markov random field</b>;
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Statistical signal processing</b>: stochastic processes are used in signal processing since, in the current state of the world, signals and other
          communications between computer can and will fail. This means that there is a need for resilience and recovery while a machine is running. This is especially
          true when we consider the theory branch that studies secure, both as in private and certain, signal passing and processing in distributed systems. Some
          branches where this is most used is in RADAR technology, estimation probles and adaptive filtering.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="color: white; background-color: black; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) </h2>
      <p>
        A <b>stochastic differential equation</b> (SDE) is a differential equation in which one or more terms are a stochastic process. In particular, these kind of
        equations involve both a deterministic and a random aspect of a described system, modeling a particular real world scenario, described by the evolution
        of the equation or, in general, described by the evolution of the process associated to its SDE. These are mostly used to model after scenarios where
        randomness plays a crucial role. Stochastic differential equations provide a link between probability theory and the much older and more developed fields of
        ordinary and partial differential equations. The general form of a <b>one-dimensional</b> SDE is the following:

        $$ dX_t = a(t, X_t) dt + b(t, X_t) dW_t $$

        In this equation, \( X_t \) is the process, \( a(t, X_t) \) and \( b(t, X_t) \) are the deterministic functions, \( dt \) is the deterministic derivative and
        \( dW_t \) is the random derivative, realted to a Brownian motion, already discussed in the <a href="/thesis/thesis10.html">tenth thesis</a>.
        Generally, SDEs provide a way to describe the evolution of a system over time, while that system is being influenced by deterministic functions as well as
        random fluctuations. A stochastic process is the solution for an SDE, however these are usually simulated, since finding a precise and mathematical solution
        for an SDE is a very complicated task that requires a lot of time and complex calculations. One of the most used technique is the Itô calculus, already discussed
        in details in the <a href="/thesis/thesis12.html">twelfth thesis</a>. Itô calculus, in particular, is an extension of calculus to stochastic processes
        such as the <i><b>Brownian motion</b></i>, with applications in finance and SDE.
        It is possible to describe different kinds of SDEs, based on they're properties and how they are defined and, therefore, simulated. In particular, we find interesting
        the difference between <b>linear</b> and <b>non linear</b>, and between <b>autonomous</b> and <b>time dependent</b> SDEs.
      </p>

      <h4> SDE Linearity </h4>
      <p>
        A <b>linear</b> stochastic differential equations is defined as such if both the <i>drift</i> function and the <i>diffusion</i> function are linear functions.
        A generalization of a linear stochastic differential equation is the following:
        $$ dX_t = a(t) X_t \ dt + b(t) X_t \ dW_t $$
        As we can see, both the first and second part of the sum are functions that are linearly dependent on time and a stochastic variable \( X_t \).
        A <b>non-linear</b> function on the other hand are those stochastic differential equations where the <i>drift</i> and <i>diffusion</i> contains
        non-linear terms. One example is a function that contains any of the trigonometric functions, since they are all non-linear, a logarithmic or an
        exponential function:
        $$ dX_t = ln(X_t) dt + X^3_t dW_t $$
      </p>
      <h4> SDE dependancy </h4>
      <p>
        An stochastic differential equation is defined as <b>autonomous</b> if the <i>drift</i> and <i>diffusion</i> are not explicitly dependent on time. One
        example is:
        $$ dX_t = a(X_t) dt + b(X_t) dW_t $$
        On the other hand, a <b>time dependent</b> SDE is such if both the <i>drift</i> and <i>diffusion</i> terms are direct functions of time, which means that
        they will change just with the passage of time:
        $$ dX_t = a(X_t, t) dt + b(X_t, t) dW_t $$
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: white; background-color: black; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> Examples of Stochastic processes with their describing SDEs </h2>
      
      <h3> Arithmetic Brownian Motion </h3>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
        <img src="/src/hw7/ABM.png" alt="Arithmetic Brownian Motion" style="width: 40%;"> </img>
        <p> $$ N = 80; M = 250; P = 0.5 $$ </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        An Arithmetic Brownian Motion is described by the following SDE:
        $$ dX_{t} = \mu \ dt + \sigma \ dW_{t} $$
        This express the changes of the Brownian; in particular the process changes by a costant amount every infinitesimal period of time.
        Formally, the first term is called <i>drift</i>, while the second term is called the <i>diffusion term</i>. In particular:
      </p>
              
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li> \( X_t \) rapresents the process value at time t, </li>
        <li> \( \mu \) is the <i>drift</i>, </li>
        <li> \(  \sigma \) is the <i>volatility</i>, </li>
        <li> \( dW_t \) is a <i>Wiener process</i>.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p> An example is shown on the image above. </p>
      <hr>

      <h3> Geometric Brownian Motion </h3>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
        <img src="/src/hw7/GBM.png" alt="Geometric Brownian Motion" style="width: 50%;"> </img>
        <p> $$ N = 80; M = 250; P = 0.5; \ \sigma = 0.5; \mu = 0.5 $$ </p>
      </div>

      <p> An Geometric Brownian Motion (also known as the exponential Brownian Motion) is a continuous-time stochastic process. In particular, it's used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in a particular financial model.
        This process is best described by its SDE, which is the following:
        $$ dS_{t} = \mu \ S_t \ dt + \sigma \ S_t \ dW_{t} $$
        This ultimately expresses the changes of the Brownian; in particular the process changes by a costant amount every infinitesimal period of time.
        As in the example above, the first constant is formally called <i>drift</i>, while the second is called <i>diffusion term</i>.
        In particular:
      </p>
          
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li> \( S_t \) rapresents the stock prices in a particular time t, </li>
        <li> \(\mu \) is the <i>drift</i>, which is the average rate of return per time unit, </li>
        <li> \( \sigma \) is the <i>volatility</i>, which rapresents the standard deviation of the flactuations, </li>
        <li> \( dW_t \) is a <i>Wiener process</i> (or the Brownian motion), which rapresents the random and continuous movements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> An example is shown on the image above. </p>
      <hr>

      <h3> Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process </h3>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
        <img src="/src/hw7/graph.png" alt="Ornstein-Uhlenbeck" style="width: 50%;"> </img>
        <p> $$ N = 80; \ M = 250; \ P = 0.5; \ \sigma = 0.4; \ \mu = 12; \ \theta = 0.2 $$</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process (also known as the Mean Reverting Process) is a stochastic proces with applications in financial mathematics and physical sciences.
        Its original application was as a model for the velocity of the Brownian particle under a particular friction. Its SDE is the following:
        $$ dX_{t} = \theta (\mu - X_t) dt + \sigma \ dW_{t} $$
        The constant parameters are:
      </p>
              
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li> \( \theta \) which is the rate (or speed) of the mean reversion. It is defined as strictly bigger than 0, </li>
        <li> \( \mu \) is the long term mean of the process. In particular, the process will tend to this particular mean, </li>
        <li> \( \sigma \) is the <i>volatility</i>. </li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
        By ignoring the random flactuations (given by the Weiner process), we see that \( X_t \)
        has an overall drift towards the mean value, as expressed above. The process reverts to this mean exponentially, with rate
        \( \theta \). An example is shown on the image on the right:
      </p>

      <h4> Vasicek Model </h4>
      <p>
        A <b> Vasicek Model </b> is a model that fundamentally follows the same same SDE of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process, however the parameter
        \( \theta \) can be a non-constant, in particular it can be a deterministic function of \( t \).
      </p>

      <h4> Hull-White Model </h4>
      <p>
        A <b> Hull-White Model </b> is an extension of the Vasicek model with the difference that it can be made to fit the current term structure. In particular, it's SDE is the following:
        $$ dX_t = [\theta (t) - \mu X_t] dt + \sigma \ dW_t $$
      </p>
      <hr>

      <h3> Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model</h3>
      <p>
        A <b>Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model</b> is similar to the Vasicek Model; however it includes a term proportional to the square root of the process.
        Its SDE is the following:
        $$ dX_t = \kappa \ ( \ \theta  - X_t \ ) dt + \sigma \ \sqrt{X_t} \ dW_t $$
      </p>
      <hr>

      <h3> Black-Karasinski Model </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Black-Karasinski Model</b> can be considered as an extension of the CIR Model. It introduces a random (or stochastic) volatility, allowing this parameter to vary over time. It's SDE is the following:
        $$ dX_t = [\ \theta(t) - \alpha X_t \ ] \ dt + \sigma(t) \ \sqrt{X_t} \ dW_t $$
        Where :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> \( \alpha \) is the speed of the mean reversion, </li>
        <li> \( \theta (t) \) is the mean reversion function, with variable t, </li>
        <li> \( \sigma(t) \) is the volatility function, with variable t, </li>
        <li> \( X_t \) is the short rate at time t. </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3> Heston Model </h3>
      <p>
        A <b>Heston Model</b> is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of the volatility of an underlying asset.
        This is defined by two stochastic equations, one for the price and one for the volatility. It's composing SDEs are:
        $$ dS_t = \mu \ S_t \ dt + \sigma \ \sqrt{V_t} \ S_t \ dW^1_t $$
        $$ dV_t = \kappa \ ( \ \theta  - V_t \ ) dt + \sigma \ \sqrt{V_t} \ dW^2_t $$
        Where :
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> \( S_t \) is the asset price at time t,</li>
        <li> \( \sigma \) is the volatility,</li>
        <li> \( V_t \) is the instantaneous variance at time t, which is the volatility squared,</li>
        <li> \( \kappa \) is the speed of mean reversion of volatility,</li>
        <li> \( \mu \) is the average rate of return,</li>
        <li> \( dW^1_t \) and \( dW^2_t \) are correlated to the Weiner process.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3> Chen Model </h3>
      <p>
        A <b>Chen Model</b> is a more complex stochastic volatility model that considers both jumps and continuous-time processes in the volatility equation.
        Its SDEs are:
        $$ dX_t = ( \mu - \lambda X_t ) \ dt + \sigma \sqrt{X_t} dW_t + dJ_t $$
        Where :
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> \( X_t \) is the volatility of the asset at a particular moment in time, </li>
        <li> \( \mu \) is the average growth rate, </li>
        <li> \( \lambda \) is the mean reverting speed, </li>
        <li> \( \sigma \) is the volatility of the process, </li>
        <li> \( dJ_t \) is a jump process. </li>
      </ul>


      <h2> Simulations </h2>
      <p>
        A simulation has already been implemented in <a href="/code/homework7/JavaScript/hw7.html">homework 7</a> (JavaScript), where most of the stochastic processes encountered in this thesis have been
        implemented. Simulations provide a hands-on approach and are sometimes critical in solving stochastic differential equations, since they are extremly hard
        and computationally expensive to solve analytically. It is possible to look at the code implementation of the simulations linked above at the following
        <a href="/code/homework7/application.html"> link </a> for the application, where it's shown how the application is built and a GitHub link can be followed to
        look at the entire project and website.
